# Project: SwitchJoy
***(Homebrew - (Severe Exploits + Bricks + Bans)) + HTML/JS/CSS = Magic***


## What is it?

SwitchJoy is a set of Javascript Libraries that help to make Switch Homebrew possible with only Switchbru DNS, some HTML/JS/CSS knowlege, and a Webpage!

## Why?

* Prevent (console) bans
* Help shape the future of the World Wide Web
* No more severe exploits, we all win (Including Nintendo!) :)

## But wait, can I do it on a LAN?

Sure, but it's pretty advanced. Basically: setup a DNSMasq server with your web server's local ip pointing to conntest.nintendowifi.net (make sure to "sudo service dnsmasq restart" after editing "/etc/hosts"!) and just like that you have a basic homebrew app!
